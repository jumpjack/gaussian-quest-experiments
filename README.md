Experiments with 3d gaussian splats and Meta Quest VR viewer

## Relaxing places

It's winter, it's raining, but you want to relax outside under the sun, reading a book? Try these virtual places (experimental): save them to your Meta Quest viewer, then open them in [Wakufactory](https://wakufactory.jp/wxr/splats/splatview.html) viewer, then select "AR"; then move to the hollow area: there you can "sit", and your hands and your books hould be visible in passthrough, allowing you to read.
